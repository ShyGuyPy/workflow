A place for random thoughts and notes on DREX:

Done-
-build toy logic and Shiny app(DREX_toy_colors.Rmd)
-added external css to DREX
-branched that version of DREX
-write code to pull data from 2018DREX/inputs/state/...(csv) into dataframe
-adapt existing toy logic to data frame range



Doing-
-test extent of control added css has over DREX(Shiny Dashboard framework may limit control)
-optimize design of DREX ui if/where able
-move "Today's date is..." to login bar
-make a square with changable background color

-learn in office standard practice for csv to to dataframe(look at DREX)
-include dataframe in toy model

-apply adapted logic to square in toy
-(optional)integrate toy into DREX alterante branch for testing purposes
-integrate toy into current master version of DREX
