A place for random thoughts and notes on DREX:

Done-
-build toy logic and Shiny app(DREX_toy_colors.Rmd)
-added external css to DREX
-branched that version of DREX
-write code to pull data from 2018DREX/inputs/state/...(csv) into dataframe
-adapt existing toy logic to data frame range
-learn that dashboard and shinydashboard are not the same thing. installed shinydashboard
-make a square with changable background color(valueBox)
-apply adapted logic to square in toy
-add date column value as subtitle in valueBoxOutput
-build quadrants as raw html in toy Shiny ui
-moderate testing of  extent of control added css has over DREX(Shiny Dashboard framework may limit control)
-add quadrants structure(multiple valueBox with css shrinking and arranging, or raw html elements?)
...went raw html but it needs major tweaking..good first steps
-tag$li for login bar access
-(optional)integrate toy into DREX alterante branch for testing purposes
-output sim_today varaible output reactively to tag$li in login bar
-build toy DREX for testing/practice of:
html/css feature integration, various reactive render types, andShiny in general
-add an inputSlider to toy for date selection

Doing-
-merge CSS branch and master branch of DREX
-write bool logic to replace current pseudo logic for precip, gw, reservoir(q), and stor
-link existing code to current date rather than slider
-add title bars above squares
-write code to iter thru df, find date and spit out value
-deep testing of extent of control added css has over DREX
-optimize design of DREX ui if/where able
-learn in office standard practice for csv to to dataframe(look at DREX)


-check to make sure main.css link is implemented correctly(currently ref in sidebarpanel, not in dashboardbody...)
-learn/use/build reactive objects(data <- reactive({do a thing to input$value}))



UI adjustments needed (after meeting Wed 9/12/18):
-tighten layout (adjust heighs)
-remove "Flow at Point of Rocks Panel"
-move quadrant of graphs up
-inscrease readabbility of large graph, simply small graphs
-tweak css until it pops
