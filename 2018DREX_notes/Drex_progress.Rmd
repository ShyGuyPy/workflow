-added external css to DREX
-branched that version of DREX

-optimize design of DREX ui if/where able
-move "Today's date is..." to login bar
-make a square with changable background color
-write code to pull data from 2018DREX/inputs/state/...(csv) into dataframe
-include dataframe in toy model
-adapt existing toy logic to data frame range
-apply adapted logic to square in toy
-(optional)integrate toy into DREX alterante branch for testing purposes
-integrate toy into current master version of DREX
