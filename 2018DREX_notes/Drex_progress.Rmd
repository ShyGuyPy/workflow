A place for random thoughts and notes on DREX:

Done-
-build toy logic and Shiny app(DREX_toy_colors.Rmd)
-added external css to DREX
-branched that version of DREX
-write code to pull data from 2018DREX/inputs/state/...(csv) into dataframe
-adapt existing toy logic to data frame range
-learn that dashboard and shinydashboard are not the same thing. installed shinydashboard
-make a square with changable background color(valueBox)
-apply adapted logic to square in toy


Doing-
-test extent of control added css has over DREX(Shiny Dashboard framework may limit control)
-optimize design of DREX ui if/where able
-move "Today's date is..." to login bar


-learn in office standard practice for csv to to dataframe(look at DREX)

-(optional)integrate toy into DREX alterante branch for testing purposes
-integrate toy into current master version of DREX 
-check to make sure main.css link is implemented correctly(currently ref in sidebarpanel, not in dashboardbody...)
