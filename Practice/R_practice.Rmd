factors in R:
https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/12-supp-factors/
not char or string,
they are integers and behave as such
```{r}
library(magrittr)

fruits <- factor(c("grape", "bananna", "grape", "bananna", "apple", "orange"))
#sets order of factor levels
fruits <- factor(fruits, levels = c("orange", "grape", "bananna", "apple"), ordered = TRUE)
levels(fruits)
nlevels(fruits)

fruits %>%
  trimws() %>%
  print()

```

trimws():
```{r}
thing <- " this is a test   "
print(trimws(thing))
#and again using pipes
thing %>% 
  trimws() %>%
  print()

```


about purrr:

```{r}
library("purrr")
```
