a space for practicing basic shiny app elements, features and ...well.. practices:

isolate(input$value...) makes input non-reactive

observeEvent

looks as though the Cairo package may have some issues on Mac(working from home today and it popped up so and trying to resolve it):
```{r}
library(shiny)
library(Cairo)


```
