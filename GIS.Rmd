Geographic Information Systems

Note about Maryland drought layer/shapefile:
"Note that these shapefiles lack a prj file, but the projection is Maryland State Plane NAD-83 meters."

There are also supposed to be instructions for use of this...

So we seem to be mising the western region of the maryland map as well as the instructions.

What we  know now is that we are using a cartesian coordinate system rather than a spherical lat/long system.  We are using cartesian because State Palen Coordinates use cartesian(x,y).  The shapefiles do not have an assigned proj4string/epsg, so the appropriate label must be assigned.  Likely 2248 or could be 26985.  I've tried both and neither generated a leaflet output, so don't know at this point.
