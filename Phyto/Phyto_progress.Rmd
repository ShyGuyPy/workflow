Done: 
-get mmir working on my machine
-download CDER and ITIS data
-get pibi_notebook knitting error free on my machine
-read through the majority of pibi_notebook
-learn ggplot basics
-test use of custom function clean_up()
-take a look at scripts in project folder on Zach's old computer(up to date)
-download and work/play with virginia phytoplankton count and event data in Phyto
-download data through pibi_notebook script from url.root <- "http://datahub.chesapeakebay.net/api.JSON"
-do some exploratory data ananysis on phyto data to familiarize yourself both with the data and the EDA process
-edit typos
-send Claire pibi_notebook html by adding Pibi2 to H drive
-figure out where files are being output with fwrite: 
  1. "data/phytoplankton/cedr_phyto_taxa.csv"
  2. "data/phytoplankton/cedr_phyto_event.csv"
  3. "data/phytoplankton/cedr_phyto_station.csv"
  4. "data/water_quality/cedr_wq.csv"
  5. "data/itis/itis_hierarchy.csv"
-replace data_acquistion_cedr with data_input that pulls VA ODU data into phyto2

Doing: 
-ask Zach about 1) issue with dir.create when knitting pibi_notebook 2)also knit as start button?
3)
-get all data in phyto2 going to the right input
-figure out why directory/excel is not being generated in workflow when using Zach's code snippet
-get an output from phyto2
-generate a list of questions about data importing from CEDR to ask Mike Mallonee
-produce an output (xls)


-finish working through R For Data Science
-evaluate ibi metric code to the point where you could effectively bug check it
-know the parts of MMIR package that are applicable to phyto



understand steps:

download data and dependencies

-downlaod CEDR data(from API, url.root <- "http://datahub.chesapeakebay.net/api.JSON"
-install packages(including MMIR)
-create vesctor for station data
-download all of the phytoplankton data from the CEDR API
