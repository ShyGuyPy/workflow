This is a place for general notes as I examine, unpack, and eventually come to understand Zach's R/Shiny code for the Phyto project.

I'm using this process as a way to:
1) learning R markdown
2) improve my understanding of Zach's code
3) practice comprehensive documentation
4) document so I can repeat and others can follow

Directory structure is important for maintainability/ scalability of code.  The three main components of a Shiny app are global, ui and server (making up initial directory branching).
