I am not a water scientist.  This is a place for me to document the very basics of water scinec I am learning as I work on the Phyto project with Claire.  

Currently I'm reading through "Revisiting the Chesapeake Bay Phytoplankton Index of Biotic Integrity" by Claire Buchanan and Jaquiline M. Johnson to try and get a basic grasp of the basic terms and concepts involved(so that at the very least I can know what each variable is referring to and have some idea what the datat should look like).


IBI is index of biological Integrity and it measures human(anthro)impact on water quality.  Observations on Phytoplankton are the main focus

DOC is dissolved organic carbon
